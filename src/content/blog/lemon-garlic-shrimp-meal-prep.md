Look, I'm just gonna say it — shrimp is criminally underrated for meal prep.

People always default to chicken. Chicken this, chicken that. And yeah, chicken's fine. But shrimp? Cooks in literally 3 minutes. High protein. Low calorie. And when you hit it with some garlic butter and lemon? *Chef's kiss.*

This lemon garlic shrimp meal prep is one of those recipes that makes you look like you know what you're doing in the kitchen, even if you definitely don't. I've made it on Sunday nights when I was half-asleep and it still turned out great.

## Why This Recipe Works for Meal Prep

Shrimp reheats way better than you'd think. The key is not overcooking it in the first place (we'll get to that), and the lemon-garlic butter situation actually gets *more* flavorful after sitting in the fridge for a day.

The whole thing takes 15 minutes. Maybe 20 if you're slow like me on a Sunday evening.

**Here's what you're working with:**
- 32g protein per container
- Under 400 calories
- About $3.25 per serving (less if you catch shrimp on sale)
- 5 days of lunches, done

## The Shopping Situation

You need like 6 things. Maybe 8 if you count salt and pepper, which I don't because you already have those.

| Ingredient | Approx. Cost | Where to Find It |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Shrimp (1.5 lbs) | $10-12 | Frozen section is fine |
| Butter | $1 | Dairy aisle |
| Garlic | $0.50 | Produce |
| Lemons (2) | $1 | Produce |
| Rice | $1 | Pantry staple |
| Broccoli | $2 | Frozen or fresh |

Total damage: roughly $16 for 5 meals. That's the math.

**Pro tip:** Buy frozen shrimp. It's usually fresher than the "fresh" stuff at the counter because it's flash-frozen on the boat. The fancy shrimp at the seafood counter? Often just thawed frozen shrimp with a markup.

## Let's Cook This Thing

### Step 1: Get Your Mise en Place Together

Hate that phrase but it's accurate. Shrimp cooks SO fast that if you're mincing garlic while the butter's burning, you're gonna have a bad time.

Before the pan even gets hot:
- Thaw your shrimp if frozen (cold water bath, 10 minutes)
- Mince the garlic
- Juice the lemons
- Zest one of them
- Chop the parsley

Rice should already be made. Batch cook it on the weekend like a normal meal prepper. Or use those 90-second microwave pouches — no judgment.

### Step 2: The Actual Cooking Part

Big skillet or pan. Medium-high heat. Add the butter — all 4 tablespoons, yes, we're doing this right.

Once it's melted and starting to foam a little:

1. Toss in the garlic. Stir it around for maybe 30 seconds. You want fragrant, not burnt.

2. Add the shrimp in a single layer. DON'T touch them for 90 seconds. Let them get that nice sear.

3. Flip them. Another 90 seconds. They should be pink and curled into a C-shape. If they're curled into an O, you overcooked them. It happens. They'll still taste fine.

4. Kill the heat. Pour in the lemon juice and zest. It'll sizzle. Toss in the parsley. Stir everything together.

That's it. That's the whole recipe.

## Assembly Time

Get your containers out. I use 5 glass ones because plastic absorbs smells and I'm not trying to have lemon-garlic-flavored oatmeal next week.

In each container:
- ~2/3 cup rice
- ~3/4 cup broccoli  
- Divide the shrimp evenly (should be about 5-6 large shrimp per container)
- SPOON THAT BUTTER SAUCE OVER EVERYTHING

That last part is non-negotiable. The sauce is what makes this.

## How to Store It

Fridge: 5 days, easy. The shrimp stays good, the sauce keeps everything moist, no issues.

Freezer: I wouldn't. Shrimp texture gets weird when frozen and reheated. Just make a fresh batch next week.

## Reheating Without Destroying It

This is where people mess up meal prep shrimp.

**Best method:** Remove the lid, microwave at 70% power for 2 minutes. Check it. Hit it for another 30 seconds if needed.

**Why 70% power?** Full power nukes the shrimp into rubber. Lower power heats it more evenly. Your coworkers will think you're fancy.

Alternatively, dump it in a pan with a splash of water, cover it, and reheat on medium for 2-3 minutes. Takes longer but the texture is slightly better.

## Variations If You Get Bored

After your third week of making this, you might want to switch it up:

- **Cajun version:** Add 1 tsp cajun seasoning with the garlic
- **Honey garlic:** Replace lemon juice with 2 tbsp honey + 1 tbsp soy sauce
- **Creamy lemon:** Stir in 1/4 cup heavy cream at the end (calorie bump but worth it)
- **Spicy:** Red pepper flakes. Start with 1/2 tsp.

The base technique stays the same. Shrimp don't care what flavor profile you're going for.

## Real Talk: Is Shrimp Worth the Price?

I get this question. Shrimp isn't the cheapest protein. Let's break it down:

**Chicken breast:** ~$3/lb → 4oz serving = $0.75
**Shrimp (frozen):** ~$7/lb → 4oz serving = $1.75

So yeah, shrimp is about twice the cost per serving.

But. BUT.

- It cooks in 3 minutes vs. 20+ for chicken
- The texture variety in your meal prep is worth something
- It *feels* fancier, which matters when you're eating the same thing for 5 days
- Higher protein density gram-for-gram

I rotate this with my chicken recipes. Two weeks chicken, one week shrimp. Keeps things interesting without destroying the budget.

Honestly, this is one of those recipes where the effort-to-reward ratio is absurdly good. 15 minutes of actual work for a full week of lunches that taste like you actually tried.

Make it this Sunday. You'll be annoyed you didn't start making it sooner.
