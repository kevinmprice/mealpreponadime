## Instructions

### Step 1: Season and Cook the Chicken

Season chicken breasts with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper on both sides.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook **6-7 minutes per side** until golden brown and internal temp reaches 165°F.

Remove chicken and let it rest on a cutting board. Slice into strips once rested.

### Step 2: Cook Your Pasta

While the chicken cooks, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook penne according to package directions (usually 10-12 minutes).

**Important:** Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining. This starchy water is liquid gold for your sauce.

### Step 3: Make the Tuscan Sauce

In the same skillet (don't clean it — that fond is flavor!), add a splash more olive oil if needed.

Sauté minced garlic for **30 seconds** until fragrant. Add sun-dried tomatoes and cook 1 minute.

Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth. Bring to a gentle simmer and let it reduce for **3-4 minutes**.

Stir in parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 4: Bring It All Together

Add spinach to the sauce and stir until wilted (about 2 minutes).

Add the cooked pasta and sliced chicken back to the pan. Toss everything together.

If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of that reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.

### Step 5: Portion for the Week

Let the pasta cool for 10 minutes before portioning.

Divide evenly into 5 meal prep containers. Top each with a little extra parmesan if desired.

## Storage Instructions

| Storage Method | How Long | Reheating |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **Refrigerator** | 5 days | Microwave 2-3 min, add splash of cream |
| **Freezer** | 3 months | Thaw overnight, reheat on stovetop |

**Pro tip:** The sauce thickens when cold. Add a tablespoon of cream or milk when reheating to restore that silky texture.

## Why This Works for Meal Prep

**The sauce holds up:** Unlike some cream sauces that break when reheated, this one stays creamy. The parmesan and starchy pasta water create an emulsion that's stable.

**The chicken stays tender:** Slicing after resting and coating in sauce means it won't dry out during storage.

**The spinach adds nutrition:** You're getting protein, carbs, AND vegetables in every container. No sad desk lunches here.

**It reheats in minutes:** Pop it in the microwave, add a splash of liquid, and you've got a lunch that'll make your coworkers jealous.

## Common Questions

**Can I use a different pasta shape?**
Absolutely. Rigatoni, farfalle, or even spaghetti work great. Just adjust cooking time per the package.

**What if I don't have sun-dried tomatoes?**
Roasted red peppers are a good substitute. Or skip them entirely — it'll still be delicious.

**Is this kid-friendly?**
Most kids love this! If yours are picky about "green stuff," blend the spinach into the sauce.

**Can I make this dairy-free?**
Use full-fat coconut cream instead of heavy cream and nutritional yeast instead of parmesan. Different but still tasty.
