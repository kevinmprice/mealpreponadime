## Why This Recipe Works for Meal Prep

Turkey taco bowls hit the meal prep sweet spot: they're fast to make, cheap, high in protein, and actually taste *better* after sitting in the fridge for a day. The flavors meld together, and the rice soaks up all that seasoning. If you're new to this, our [beginner's guide](/blog/meal-prep-beginners-guide) covers all the basics.

Plus, ground turkey is usually $4-5/lb — way cheaper than chicken breast while giving you nearly the same protein. Want to go even cheaper? Check out our [15 recipes under $2](/blog/15-cheap-meal-prep-recipes-under-2-dollars) or the [$25 weekly meal plan](/blog/25-dollar-weekly-meal-prep-plan).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Rice

Start with the rice since it takes longest.

1. Rinse 2 cups rice under cold water
2. Add to pot with 4 cups water and a pinch of salt
3. Bring to boil, reduce to low, cover for 18 minutes
4. Fluff with fork, squeeze in lime juice, mix in chopped cilantro
5. Set aside

**Pro tip:** Make cilantro lime rice by adding the zest of the lime too — it makes a huge difference.

### Step 2: Cook the Turkey

1. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add ground turkey, breaking it up with spatula
3. Cook 6-7 minutes until no longer pink
4. Add taco seasoning and 1/4 cup water
5. Stir and simmer 3-4 minutes until sauce thickens
6. Remove from heat

### Step 3: Prep the Toppings

1. Drain and rinse black beans
2. Drain corn
3. Dice tomatoes if using fresh (or drain canned)
4. Chop extra cilantro for garnish

### Step 4: Assemble the Bowls

Divide evenly into 5 meal prep containers:

1. **Base:** 3/4 cup cilantro lime rice
2. **Protein:** 4 oz seasoned turkey
3. **Beans:** 1/4 cup black beans
4. **Corn:** 1/4 cup corn
5. **Tomatoes:** 2 tbsp diced tomatoes
6. **Cheese:** Sprinkle of shredded cheese

## Storage Tips

**Refrigerator:** 5 days in airtight containers. The flavors actually improve after day 1.

**Freezer:** Up to 3 months. Best to freeze without the cheese and tomatoes — add fresh when reheating.

**Reheating:** Microwave 2-2.5 minutes. Add a splash of water to keep rice from drying out. Or reheat in skillet for crispy rice edges.

---

## Variations

**Make it spicier:** Add diced jalapeños, chipotle peppers, or hot sauce.

**Low carb version:** Skip the rice, double the veggies, serve over lettuce.

**Vegetarian:** Use 2 cans of black beans instead of turkey, add extra corn and peppers.

**Southwest twist:** Add roasted bell peppers and use chipotle seasoning instead of taco.

**Burrito bowl style:** Add sour cream, guacamole, and salsa when serving.
