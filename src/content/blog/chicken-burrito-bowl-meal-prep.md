Chipotle runs like $13 a bowl now. Sometimes more if you dare ask for guac.

Here's the thing though — burrito bowls are stupid easy to make at home. And when you meal prep them? You're looking at five lunches for what you'd pay for one restaurant bowl.

Forty-five minutes on Sunday. Lunch handled through Friday. Let's go.

## Why This Recipe Works for Meal Prep

Some foods don't survive the fridge. Burrito bowls? They actually get *better*. The rice absorbs the flavors from everything around it. The chicken stays juicy if you don't overcook it. And unlike a sad desk salad, this feels like real food.

The key is keeping certain things separate until you eat. More on that in a sec.

## What You'll Need

**For the chicken:**
- 1.5 lbs chicken breast (or thighs — your call)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 packet taco seasoning (or make your own, recipe below)
- Salt and pepper

**For the cilantro lime rice:**
- 2 cups long-grain rice
- 3 cups water or chicken broth
- Juice of 2 limes
- 1/3 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 tbsp butter
- Salt to taste

**For the bowls:**
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (15 oz) corn, drained (or frozen, thawed)
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 red onion, diced
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Lime wedges

**Optional toppings (pack separately):**
- Shredded cheese
- Sour cream
- Salsa or pico de gallo
- Guacamole (add day-of)
- Jalapeños

## The Process

### Step 1: Get the Rice Going

Start here because it takes the longest.

Rinse your rice until the water runs mostly clear. Yeah, this step matters. Combine rice and water/broth in a pot, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook 18 minutes. Don't peek.

When it's done, fluff with a fork and immediately add the butter, lime juice, and cilantro. Stir it in while the rice is hot — that's when it absorbs flavor best.

Set aside and let it cool a bit.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken

While the rice does its thing, handle the protein.

Pound your chicken breasts to even thickness (about 3/4 inch). This isn't optional if you want even cooking. Uneven chicken = dry spots and raw spots. Neither is great.

Season both sides with taco seasoning, salt, and pepper.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it's shimmering, add chicken. Cook 6-7 minutes per side until internal temp hits 165°F.

Let it rest 5 minutes (seriously, don't skip this), then slice or dice however you like.

### Step 3: Assemble Your Bowls

Grab 5 meal prep containers. Here's how I layer:

1. **Base**: About 3/4 cup cilantro lime rice
2. **Protein**: Sliced chicken (about 4 oz per container)
3. **Beans**: A scoop of black beans
4. **Corn**: Another scoop
5. **Fresh stuff**: Cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro

If you're adding cheese, you can put it on now. Sour cream, guac, and salsa should go in small separate containers or you're asking for soggy sadness.

## Cost Breakdown

Let's do the math on 5 servings:

| Ingredient | Cost |
|------------|------|
| 1.5 lbs chicken breast | $5.50 |
| 2 cups rice | $0.80 |
| Black beans (can) | $0.89 |
| Corn (can) | $0.79 |
| Tomatoes | $1.50 |
| Limes (2) | $0.60 |
| Cilantro | $0.79 |
| Red onion | $0.50 |
| Seasonings | $0.50 (estimate) |
| **Total** | **~$12-13** |

That's roughly **$2.50 per bowl**. Versus $13+ at Chipotle. You do the math.

## Storage and Reheating

**How long do they last?** 
Safely 4-5 days in the fridge. By day 5 the rice won't be quite as fluffy, but it's still good.

**Reheating options:**

Microwave 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through. Add a splash of water if the rice seems dry.

If you have access to a stove at work (lucky), warm everything in a pan with a tiny bit of oil. Takes longer but tastes better.

**What about freezing?**

You can freeze the chicken and rice portion for up to 3 months. I'd leave out the fresh tomatoes and onion for those. Add fresh toppings when you're ready to eat.

## Making It Your Own

This is a template, not a rulebook.

**Swap the protein:** Ground beef works great with the same taco seasoning. Carnitas if you're feeling fancy. Even shrimp if you'll eat it within 2-3 days.

**Change the rice:** Regular white rice is fine. Brown rice adds fiber. Cauliflower rice if you're going low-carb.

**Add heat:** Throw some pickled jalapeños in there. Hot sauce on the side. A chipotle pepper diced into the chicken while cooking.

**Make it vegetarian:** Double the beans, add some sautéed peppers, maybe some crispy tofu.

## Homemade Taco Seasoning

The packets work fine, but if you want to control the sodium (those things are salt bombs) or just prefer making your own:

Mix together:
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp cayenne (optional)
- Salt to taste

This makes enough for about 1.5 lbs of protein.

## Tips From Experience

**Don't overcook the chicken.** Use a thermometer. 165°F internal and you're good. Higher means dry.

**Warm up the beans.** Cold beans in a warm bowl is weird. Either heat them during assembly or microwave the whole thing together.

**Lime juice on everything.** Squeeze fresh lime over the bowl when you eat it. Game changer.

**Invest in good containers.** Glass lasts longer and doesn't stain from the seasoning. Plus it looks less sad at the office.

The real secret to meal prep isn't complicated recipes or fancy ingredients. It's having food ready that you actually want to eat. 

Burrito bowls hit that mark every time.
