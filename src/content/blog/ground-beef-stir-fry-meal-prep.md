Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. I didn't grow up making stir fry. My family's idea of "Asian food" was whatever came in those frozen dinner bags from Costco. But somewhere in my twenties, I figured out that ground beef stir fry is basically cheat mode for meal prep.

**Why?** Because it takes 20 minutes, costs almost nothing, and somehow tastes like you spent way more effort than you did.

## Why Ground Beef Stir Fry Works for Meal Prep

Here's the thing most people don't realize: ground beef is actually *better* for stir fry than the sliced steak you see in restaurant versions. It cooks faster, soaks up sauce like a sponge, and — this is the important part — it's half the price.

Quick math time:
- Ground beef (80/20): ~$4.50/lb at most grocery stores
- "Stir fry beef strips": ~$8-12/lb

Same protein. Same meal. Half the cost. I don't understand why more people don't do this.

## The Full Recipe

### Ingredients (Makes 5 Meals)

| Ingredient | Amount | Cost |
|------------|--------|------|
| Ground beef (80/20) | 1.5 lbs | $6.75 |
| Mixed vegetables | 4 cups | $3.00 |
| Jasmine rice | 2 cups dry | $0.80 |
| Soy sauce | 3 tbsp | $0.25 |
| Oyster sauce | 2 tbsp | $0.30 |
| Garlic, ginger, sesame oil | — | $0.25 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$9.35** |

That's **$1.87 per meal**. For real food that actually fills you up.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Rice first (obviously)**

Get your rice going before anything else. 2 cups dry jasmine rice + 2.5 cups water. Rice cooker if you have one, stovetop if you don't. I'm not gonna tell you how to cook rice — you're an adult.

**Step 2: Brown the beef**

Crank your biggest skillet to medium-high. Don't add oil yet — 80/20 beef has enough fat. Throw in the ground beef and break it up with a spatula.

Here's where most people mess up: *don't stir it constantly*. Let it actually brown. Get some crispy bits. That's flavor. That's the whole point.

About 6-7 minutes until it's cooked through with some nice browning.

**Step 3: Aromatics**

Push the beef to the side of the pan. Add a tiny bit of sesame oil to the empty spot. Toss in your garlic and ginger. Stir that around for like 30 seconds until it smells incredible.

Don't burn the garlic. Burned garlic is bitter and gross. If you smell it starting to get dark, mix everything together immediately.

**Step 4: Vegetables**

Add your vegetables. I use whatever's on sale honestly. The classics:
- Bell peppers (any color)
- Broccoli florets
- Snap peas
- Carrots (sliced thin)

Stir fry for 3-4 minutes. You want them cooked but still with some snap to them. Nobody wants mushy broccoli.

**Step 5: Sauce time**

Mix together: 3 tbsp soy sauce + 2 tbsp oyster sauce + 1 tbsp water

Pour it over everything. Toss to coat. Let it bubble for about a minute until it slightly thickens and glazes everything.

Done.

## Meal Prep Container Strategy

I've tested a lot of ways to pack this, and here's what works:

**Option A: All together**
Rice on the bottom, stir fry on top. Simple. Works fine if you're eating within 4 days.

**Option B: Keep rice separate** (my preference)
Rice in a separate small container or use divided meal prep containers. The rice stays better and doesn't get soggy from the sauce.

Either way, these keep for 5 days in the fridge. I wouldn't push it past that.

> **Reheating tip:** Add a splash of water before microwaving. Covers it loosely. 2 minutes. The steam brings everything back to life.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Using extra lean beef**
Don't. 90/10 or 93/7 ground beef will be dry and sad. The fat is flavor. The fat keeps it moist after reheating. 80/20 is the sweet spot.

**Overcrowding the pan**
If your skillet isn't big enough, do the beef in batches. Crowded pan = steamed meat = no browning = disappointing dinner.

**Skipping the oyster sauce**
You can technically make this with just soy sauce, but... why? Oyster sauce adds this deep savory thing that makes it taste like takeout. It's like $3 at any grocery store and lasts forever.

**Adding everything at once**
Beef → aromatics → vegetables → sauce. In that order. There's a reason.

## Variations to Keep It Interesting

Because eating the exact same thing gets old, even when it's good:

- **Spicy version:** Add 1 tbsp sriracha or chili garlic sauce to the sauce mixture
- **Teriyaki-ish:** Swap oyster sauce for 2 tbsp brown sugar + extra soy sauce
- **Low-carb:** Skip the rice, serve over cauliflower rice or just eat the stir fry
- **Extra vegetables:** Whatever needs to be used up. Mushrooms, zucchini, cabbage — all work

I rotate through these so I'm never bored.

## The Real Cost Breakdown

Let's be specific because I know some of you are skeptical:

| Store | Ground Beef (1.5 lb) | Total Recipe |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Walmart | $6.22 | $8.72 |
| Aldi | $5.99 | $8.49 |
| Costco | $5.69 | $8.19 |
| Regular grocery | $6.75 | $9.25 |

So we're looking at **$1.64 - $1.85 per meal** depending on where you shop. That's cheaper than the gas to get fast food.

## FAQ

**Does this freeze well?**
Honestly? Not great. The vegetables get weird. I'd stick to fridge storage and eat within 5 days.

**Can I use turkey instead?**
You *can*, but it won't be as good. Turkey is leaner and drier. If you go that route, add an extra tablespoon of oil.

**What rice should I use?**
Jasmine is my go-to because it's slightly sticky and holds sauce well. Long grain works too. Avoid minute rice.

**How do I prevent soggy vegetables?**
High heat, don't overcrowd, and don't overcook. They should still have texture when you take them off the heat — they'll continue cooking a bit from residual heat.

## Final Thoughts

I've made this probably 200+ times. It's one of those recipes that just *works*. Fast to make, cheap to buy, easy to customize, and it reheats without turning into sadness.

If you're new to meal prep, start here. Seriously. It's hard to mess up, and even if you do, it'll still be edible. That's the kind of low-stakes cooking we need more of.

Now go make it. Your future self will thank you when it's Wednesday and you have actual food ready to eat.
