## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Sauce

In a small bowl, whisk together:
- 1/4 cup honey
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp water

Set aside. This is what creates that gorgeous glossy coating.

### Step 2: Start the Rice

Add 2 cups rice and 4 cups water to a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18 minutes. Don't peek!

### Step 3: Cook the Chicken

1. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels (this helps them brown)
2. Season both sides with salt and pepper
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
4. Add chicken and cook **5-6 minutes per side** until golden and cooked through (165°F internal)
5. Remove chicken and set aside

### Step 4: Make the Glaze

1. Lower heat to medium
2. Add minced garlic to the same pan — cook 30 seconds until fragrant
3. Pour in the honey soy mixture
4. Stir constantly as it thickens (about 1-2 minutes)
5. Return chicken to the pan and coat both sides with the glaze

### Step 5: Steam the Broccoli

While the chicken is glazing, steam or microwave your broccoli until bright green and tender-crisp (about 3-4 minutes).

### Step 6: Assemble Your Meal Prep

Divide evenly into 5 containers:
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 1 glazed chicken thigh
- 3/4 cup broccoli
- Drizzle any remaining sauce over the chicken

## Storage Tips

**Refrigerator:** 5 days in airtight containers. The sauce actually gets better as it soaks into the chicken.

**Freezer:** Up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge, then reheat.

**Reheating:** Microwave 2-3 minutes, or until heated through. Add a splash of water before microwaving to keep the chicken moist.

## Easy Variations

**Spicy honey garlic:** Add 1 tsp sriracha or red pepper flakes to the sauce.

**Sesame ginger:** Add 1 tbsp sesame oil and 1 tsp fresh grated ginger.

**Low-carb version:** Swap rice for cauliflower rice (saves about 150 calories per serving).

**Different protein:** This sauce works great on salmon, shrimp, or tofu too.

## Why Chicken Thighs?

I always use **thighs instead of breasts** for meal prep:

1. **Cheaper** — Usually $1-2/lb less than breasts
2. **More flavorful** — The extra fat = more taste
3. **Stays moist** — Won't dry out when reheated
4. **Harder to overcook** — More forgiving for beginners

If you only have chicken breast, it'll still work — just be careful not to overcook it.
