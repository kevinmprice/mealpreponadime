## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Sauce (2 minutes)

Whisk together honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, rice vinegar, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Set aside.

In a separate small bowl, mix cornstarch with water to create a slurry. Set aside.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken (15 minutes)

1. Pat chicken thighs dry and season with salt and pepper
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
3. Add chicken and cook **5-6 minutes per side** until golden and cooked through (internal temp 165°F)
4. Remove chicken and set aside

### Step 3: Make the Glaze (3 minutes)

1. Lower heat to medium
2. Pour honey garlic sauce into the same skillet
3. Let it bubble for 1 minute
4. Add cornstarch slurry and stir until thickened (about 1 minute)
5. Return chicken to the pan and coat with sauce

### Step 4: Prep the Sides (while chicken cooks)

**Rice:** Cook 2 cups jasmine rice according to package directions

**Broccoli:** Cut into florets, steam for 4-5 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp

### Step 5: Assemble Your Meal Prep

Divide into 5 containers:
- 3/4 cup rice
- 1 chicken thigh, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli
- Drizzle extra sauce on top
- Sprinkle with sesame seeds

## Storage Tips

- **Fridge:** 5 days in airtight containers
- **Freezer:** Up to 3 months (thaw overnight in fridge)
- **Reheating:** Microwave 2-3 minutes, or skillet for crispier chicken

**Pro tip:** Store sauce separately if you want to keep the chicken from getting too soft. Drizzle when ready to eat.

## Variations

**Spicy Honey Garlic:** Add 1 tsp sriracha or red pepper flakes to the sauce

**Low-Carb Version:** Skip the rice, double the broccoli, add cauliflower rice

**Chicken Breast:** Works fine, but thighs are juicier and cheaper. Cook to 165°F internal.

**Sheet Pan Method:** Bake chicken at 400°F for 25 minutes, brush with sauce halfway through

---

## Why This Recipe Works

The secret is the **cornstarch slurry**. It thickens the sauce so it clings to the chicken instead of running off. The honey caramelizes slightly in the hot pan, giving you that sticky-sweet coating you'd get at a restaurant.

Chicken thighs are essential here — they stay moist even after 5 days in the fridge. Breasts tend to dry out.
