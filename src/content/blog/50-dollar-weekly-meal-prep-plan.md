## Key Takeaways

- **$50 feeds you for 7 days** — that's $7.14/day or $2.38/meal
- **21 meals total** — breakfast, lunch, dinner, plus snacks
- **More variety** than our $25 plan — 3 different proteins, 5+ vegetables
- **2.5-hour Sunday prep** — slightly longer for more variety
- **Includes snacks** — Greek yogurt, cheese sticks, fruit

This is our most popular meal plan for a reason. The $50 budget hits the sweet spot: enough variety to keep meals interesting, but still way cheaper than eating out or buying convenience food.

If you're a single person or couple looking to eat well without spending $400+/month on groceries, this plan is for you.

## Meal Prep Container Strategy

For this plan, you'll need:

| Container Type | Quantity | Used For |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| 3-compartment (large) | 5 | Lunch bowls |
| 2-compartment (medium) | 4 | Dinners |
| Small containers | 5 | Yogurt portions |
| Mason jars | 3 | Overnight oats |

**💡 Pro Tip: Glass vs Plastic**

> Glass containers cost more upfront but last forever, don't stain, and are microwave-safe without worry. Start with a 10-pack for $25 — they'll pay for themselves in weeks.

|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **This meal prep** | $50 | $200 |
| Fast food (2 meals/day) | $140 | $560 |

## Customization Ideas

### Make It Vegetarian
Swap chicken and beef for:
- Extra eggs
- Canned chickpeas
- Black beans
- Tofu (often $2/block)

### Make It Low-Carb
- Skip rice, double the vegetables
- Add avocado (when on sale)
- Use lettuce wraps instead of bread

### Make It Higher Calorie
- Add olive oil to meals
- Extra rice portions
- Peanut butter with breakfast
- Second protein serving at dinner

## Common Questions

### Can two people share this plan?

This plan is designed for one person. For a couple, simply double everything — you'll spend ~$100/week for both, which is still excellent value.

### What if I get bored mid-week?

The sauce strategy saves meals:
- Soy sauce + sesame oil = Asian bowl
- Salsa + hot sauce = Mexican bowl
- Olive oil + lemon = Mediterranean bowl

Same base ingredients, totally different flavors.

### How do I handle cravings?

Budget $5-10/week for "treats." A candy bar, coffee out, or single takeout meal won't break your budget if planned for.
