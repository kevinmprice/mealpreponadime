## Sunday Meal Prep Instructions

Set aside 2 hours on Sunday. Here's the game plan:

### Hour 1: Start the Slow Stuff

**1. Soak & cook black beans** (or use Instant Pot)
- Rinse 1 lb dried beans
- Cover with water + 1 bouillon cube
- Simmer for 1.5-2 hours (or 25 min in Instant Pot)

**2. Bake chicken thighs**
- Preheat oven to 400°F
- Season chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder
- Bake 35-40 minutes until internal temp hits 165°F
- Let rest, then slice

**3. Cook rice**
- 2 cups rice + 4 cups water
- Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover
- Simmer 18-20 minutes

### Hour 2: Prep & Assemble

**4. Prep vegetables**
- Dice 2 onions
- Shred half the cabbage
- Slice carrots

**5. Sauté vegetables**
- Cook onions until soft
- Add carrots, cook 5 min
- In separate pan, sauté cabbage until slightly wilted

**6. Hard boil eggs**
- Boil water, add eggs
- Cook 10-12 minutes
- Ice bath, then peel

**7. Portion into containers**
- 5 lunch containers: chicken + rice + cabbage
- 5 dinner containers: beans + rice + onion-carrot mix

## Storage Tips

| Item | Fridge Life | Freezer Life |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Cooked chicken | 4 days | 3 months |
| Cooked beans | 5 days | 3 months |
| Cooked rice | 5 days | 3 months |
| Hard-boiled eggs | 7 days | Don't freeze |
| Sautéed veggies | 4 days | 2 months |

**Pro move:** Prep double the beans and rice. Freeze half for next week — you'll cut your prep time in half.

## Ways to Add Variety

Eating the same thing gets boring. Here's how to mix it up without spending more:

### Sauce Rotation
- Day 1-2: Hot sauce
- Day 3-4: Soy sauce + garlic
- Day 5: Salsa

### Egg Variations
- Scrambled instead of boiled
- Fried on top of rice
- Sliced into the bean bowl

### Spice It Up
If you have pantry spices, use them:
- Cumin in the beans
- Paprika on the chicken
- Cinnamon in the oatmeal

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is $25/week realistic everywhere?

Prices vary by location. In high cost-of-living areas, budget $30-35 for this same plan. The strategy still works — you're just adjusting for local prices.

### What if I don't have an oven?

Use a stovetop! Pan-fry the chicken thighs in a skillet (6-7 min per side). Same delicious result.

### Can I swap the chicken for something else?

Absolutely. Try:
- **Ground turkey** — same price, cooks faster
- **Canned tuna** — even cheaper, no cooking
- **Extra eggs** — go vegetarian for the week

### What about fresh vegetables?

Cabbage and carrots are the budget kings — cheap, last long, and nutritious. If you find sales on broccoli, peppers, or spinach, swap them in.
