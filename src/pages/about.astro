      <h1>About MealPrepOnADime</h1>
      
      <p class="lead">We believe eating well shouldn't cost a fortune.</p>
      
      <p>MealPrepOnADime was born from a simple idea: what if we could help people eat delicious, nutritious meals for less than the cost of fast food?</p>
      
      <p>We're not professional chefs or nutritionists. We're regular people who got tired of spending $500+ a month on food that left us feeling sluggish and broke. So we started experimenting with meal prep, tracking costs down to the penny, and sharing what actually works.</p>
      
      <h2>What We're About</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real budgets.</strong> Every recipe includes actual cost breakdowns. No "$5 per serving" meals that require a $50 spice cabinet.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple ingredients.</strong> If you can't find it at a regular grocery store, we don't use it.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest reviews.</strong> We only recommend products we actually use. If something sucks, we'll tell you.</li>
        <li><strong>No gatekeeping.</strong> Meal prep shouldn't require a culinary degree. Our recipes are beginner-friendly.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Math That Started It All</h2>
      
      <p>Americans spend an average of $3,000 per year on takeout and restaurant meals. The average household grocery bill is $5,000+. That's $8,000+ per year on food.</p>
      
      <p>With smart meal prep, you can cut that in half — or more. We've helped readers save $200-400 per month just by planning ahead and cooking strategically.</p>
      
      <p>That's money for vacations, paying off debt, or just having less financial stress. Food should fuel your life, not drain your wallet.</p>
      
      <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
