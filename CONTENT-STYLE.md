# Content Style Guide — Anti-Pattern Writing

Based on SEO best practices for AI-assisted content. The goal is content that reads like a knowledgeable human, not a machine.

## Core Principles

### 1. Embedded Randomness
- Write different sections in different tones
- Some sections casual and conversational, others more technical
- Vary your "voice" throughout the article
- Don't be consistent for consistency's sake

### 2. Format Rotation
Mix these unpredictably throughout posts:
- Regular paragraphs (vary length — some short, some longer)
- Bullet points (but not for everything)
- Numbered lists (when order matters)
- Tables (for comparisons, but not every comparison)
- FAQs (sometimes at end, sometimes mid-article)
- Blockquotes (for emphasis or tips)
- Bold callouts
- Data points and statistics

**Don't:** Use the same format structure for every post
**Do:** Let the content dictate the format organically

### 3. Tone Modulation
Within the same article:
- Start conversational, get technical in the middle, end casual
- Or mix it up differently each time
- Use "I" and "you" naturally
- Throw in opinions and hot takes
- Be direct sometimes, elaborate other times

### 4. Controlled Entropy
Intentionally break "perfect" structure:
- Not every section needs the same number of subsections
- Some H2s can be short, others long
- Skip the obvious transitions sometimes
- Start some paragraphs with "And" or "But" 
- Use sentence fragments. Like this.
- Vary sentence length dramatically

## What to Avoid

❌ Same intro formula every time ("In this guide, we'll cover...")
❌ Perfect parallel structure in all lists
❌ Every section having exactly 3 bullet points
❌ Robotic transitions ("Now let's look at...", "Next, we'll discuss...")
❌ Overly balanced sections (don't force equal length)
❌ Starting every paragraph the same way

## What to Do

✅ Write like you're explaining to a friend (who's smart)
✅ Include personal opinions and takes
✅ Use rhetorical questions
✅ Vary paragraph length wildly (1 sentence to 5+)
✅ Mix formal data with casual commentary
✅ Break your own patterns before they become patterns
✅ Sound slightly chaotic but knowledgeable

## Example Transformations

**Robotic:**
"There are three main types of points programs. First, there are airline miles. Second, there are hotel points. Third, there are transferable points."

**Human:**
"Points programs basically fall into three buckets. Airline miles — you know, United, Delta, AA. Hotel points from Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton. And then the flexible stuff — Chase, Amex, Capital One — which is honestly where the real value is."

*Apply these principles to ALL content. The goal: undetectable, high-quality, rankable content.*
